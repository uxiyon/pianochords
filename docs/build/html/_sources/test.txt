.. _min_Abm_12.svg: _static/examples/stream/minor/min_Abm_12.svg



.. this is the correct definition to have both the linked image and
   the call anywhere in the page

.. |min_Abm_12.svg| image:: _static/examples/stream/minor/min_Abm_12.svg
                    :target: _static/examples/stream/minor/min_Abm_12.svg


min_Abm_12.svg_

.. ...And that is the correct call

|min_Abm_12.svg|
