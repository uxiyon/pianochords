Features
========

* Draw an empty 2 octaves piano keyboard - eventually with a title - SVG output format
* Draw any chord you can imagine (on a 2 octave keyboard) by giving note names. The chord is represented by round marks on the keys
* Print a title above the keyboard, whether there chord notes are provided or not
* Print note names below the marked keys
* Export to bitmap (PNG) file (by default, resulting is stored in SVG files)
* Force output filename prefix
* Provide zoom value to change the drawing size
* Generate many chords at once from informations taken from a stream

Motivation
----------

As you play keyboard by auto-learning and do not have enough music theory skills to read scores, you may need to draw chord as marks on a keyboard to see how to play it. Showchord is a program to help doing that. It renders chord drawings as SVG and PNG images.

As I once was talking to a friend of piano chord positions, I could not find any program to help me generate these little piano chord pictures to show him, so I wrote showchord. Then I could compose this triads.pdf_ document to help my friend learn really basic chords.

.. _triads.pdf: _static/examples/triads.pdf
The idea behind showchord is to be able to automate piano chord drawings from few information: the notes of the chords.

I hope showchord could be useful to others. You can use it to write a piano method for example.

Please let me know if you use it and tell me if you find it easy (or not) to use :-)
