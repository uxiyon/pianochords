# Todo list

- [x] Improve chord input syntax to support double sharp (bb), needed to represent a Cdim7 for instance: `C Eb Gb Bbb`
- [x] Do similar improvements to support input double sharp (x)
- [x] check if pianochords is usable, i.e. environment fits the needs
- [x] replace ugly `/usr/bin/inkscape` by a more pythonic way to call external program, at least check if present
- [ ] if inkscape is not available, then check if rsvg present, if none present, then send error message on stdout only in case of `--export` use
